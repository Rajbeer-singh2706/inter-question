    "### 1. **Explain the difference between a list and a tuple in Python.**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed after they are created, whereas tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed. Lists use square brackets `[]`, while tuples use parentheses `()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **How would you implement a stack in Python?**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: A stack can be implemented using a list. You can use the `append()` method to push an element onto the stack and `pop()` method to remove the top element.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   stack = []\n",
    "   stack.append(1)  # Push element\n",
    "   stack.append(2)\n",
    "   top_element = stack.pop()  # Pop element\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **How do you reverse a linked list?**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: The basic idea is to iterate through the list and reverse the direction of the pointers in each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Node:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, data):\n",
    "           self.data = data\n",
    "           self.next = None\n",
    "\n",
    "   def reverse_linked_list(head):\n",
    "       prev = None\n",
    "       current = head\n",
    "       while current is not None:\n",
    "           next_node = current.next\n",
    "           current.next = prev\n",
    "           prev = current\n",
    "           current = next_node\n",
    "       return prev\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **What is a dictionary in Python, and how does it differ from a list?**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. Lists are ordered collections of elements, accessed by their position (index), whereas dictionaries are accessed using keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   dict_example = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}\n",
    "   list_example = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **How would you implement a queue using Python's collections module?**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: You can implement a queue using `deque` from the `collections` module. It allows efficient appends and pops from both ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from collections import deque\n",
    "   \n",
    "   queue = deque()\n",
    "   queue.append(1)  # Enqueue\n",
    "   queue.append(2)\n",
    "   first_item = queue.popleft()  # Dequeue\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **How do you find the middle element of a singly linked list in one pass?**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: Use two pointers, one moving at twice the speed of the other. When the faster pointer reaches the end, the slower one will be at the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def find_middle(head):\n",
    "       slow = fast = head\n",
    "       while fast and fast.next:\n",
    "           slow = slow.next\n",
    "           fast = fast.next.next\n",
    "       return slow.data\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **How can you implement a binary search on a sorted list?**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: You can implement a binary search by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def binary_search(arr, target):\n",
    "       low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1\n",
    "       while low <= high:\n",
    "           mid = (low + high) // 2\n",
    "           if arr[mid] == target:\n",
    "               return mid\n",
    "           elif arr[mid] < target:\n",
    "               low = mid + 1\n",
    "           else:\n",
    "               high = mid - 1\n",
    "       return -1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **How would you implement a min-heap in Python?**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: You can use the `heapq` module to implement a min-heap. In a min-heap, the smallest element is always at the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import heapq\n",
    "\n",
    "   heap = []\n",
    "   heapq.heappush(heap, 10)\n",
    "   heapq.heappush(heap, 5)\n",
    "   heapq.heappush(heap, 20)\n",
    "\n",
    "   smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)  # Pops the smallest element\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **What are sets in Python, and how do they differ from lists?**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Lists are ordered and can contain duplicate values, whereas sets do not allow duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   set_example = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
    "   list_example = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4]  # Lists can contain duplicates\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **How would you check if a binary tree is a binary search tree (BST)?**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: A binary tree is a BST if, for every node, its left child is smaller and its right child is larger. You can use in-order traversal to check if the nodes are in increasing order.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def is_bst(node, left=float('-inf'), right=float('inf')):\n",
    "       if not node:\n",
    "           return True\n",
    "       if not (left < node.data < right):\n",
    "           return False\n",
    "       return is_bst(node.left, left, node.data) and is_bst(node.right, node.data, right)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
