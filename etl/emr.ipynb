    "#The ideal **cluster configuration** for processing **10 GB of data on a daily basis** in AWS EMR depends on the nature of the data processing job (e.g., Spark, Hadoop MapReduce), the expected job runtime, cost optimization requirements, and SLAs (Service Level Agreements). Here’s a general approach to configuring an EMR cluster:\n",
    "'''\n",
    "    ### Key Considerations:\n",
    "    1. **Data Processing Type**: Is the data processing memory-intensive (Spark) or CPU-bound (MapReduce)?\n",
    "    2. **Job Completion Time**: How fast should the processing job complete? What is the time window?\n",
    "    3. **Fault Tolerance**: Should the cluster recover automatically in case of node failures?\n",
    "    4. **Cost Optimization**: Are there any cost constraints? Should we use Spot instances?\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Cluster Configuration Suggestions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 1. **Cluster Size**:\n",
    "    - For 10 GB of data, a small to medium-sized cluster should be sufficient.\n",
    "    - Since this isn't a large amount of data, you won’t need a massive cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 2. **Master Node**:\n",
    "    - **Type**: `m5.xlarge` or `m5.large` (if job scheduling and cluster management is not intensive).\n",
    "    - **Role**: Single node for cluster management and coordination of worker nodes.\n",
    "    - **Cost**: Use an **on-demand instance** to ensure stability, as the master node should not fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 3. **Core Nodes** (Responsible for processing and storing data):\n",
    "    - **Type**: `r5.xlarge` or `r5.large` (better memory for data caching in Spark).\n",
    "    - 4 vCPUs, 32 GB memory for `r5.xlarge`.\n",
    "    - **Number of nodes**: 1–2 core nodes would typically suffice for processing 10 GB of data daily.\n",
    "    - Start with 1 node and scale based on performance needs.\n",
    "    - If the job is memory-intensive (e.g., Spark with wide transformations), use more nodes for better parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 4. **Task Nodes** (Optional and for Spot instances):\n",
    "    - You can add **task nodes** to scale temporarily for parallel processing without HDFS storage.\n",
    "    - **Type**: `r5.large` or `m5.large` Spot instances for cost reduction.\n",
    "    - **Number of nodes**: 1–2 task nodes, or leverage **auto-scaling** to scale dynamically based on workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 5. **Instance Store vs. EBS**:\n",
    "    - Use **instance store** for short-lived, temporary storage needs.\n",
    "    - If persistence is required or data needs to be stored beyond the cluster lifecycle, attach **EBS volumes** (e.g., 32–64 GB).\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 6. **Storage (S3 for input/output)**:\n",
    "    - Use **Amazon S3** for input and output data storage. It decouples compute from storage and allows for scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 7. **Spot Instances** (Optional for cost reduction):\n",
    "    - For **task nodes**, consider using **Spot instances** to reduce cost significantly (up to 90% savings).\n",
    "    - Ensure your application is resilient to node failures if using Spot instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 8. **Cluster Scaling**:\n",
    "    - Use **auto-scaling** to adjust the number of task nodes based on job execution times. This will allow you to maintain cost efficiency while scaling as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Example Configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### For a **Spark Job** Processing 10 GB Daily:\n",
    "    1. **Master Node**: 1 x `m5.large` (On-demand)\n",
    "    2. **Core Node**: 2 x `r5.large` (On-demand or Spot)\n",
    "    3. **Task Node**: 2 x `r5.large` (Spot for additional compute)\n",
    "    4. **EBS Storage**: 32 GB per node (for temporary storage if needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### For a **MapReduce Job**:\n",
    "    1. **Master Node**: 1 x `m5.large` (On-demand)\n",
    "    2. **Core Node**: 1 x `m5.xlarge` (On-demand)\n",
    "    3. **Task Node**: 2 x `m5.large` (Spot)\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### Performance & Cost Optimization Tips:\n",
    "    - **Use S3** for external storage (input/output) instead of HDFS.\n",
    "    - **Spot Instances** for task nodes can reduce costs significantly.\n",
    "    - Use **auto-termination** of clusters once the job is complete to save costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Fine-Tuning the Cluster:\n",
    "    - If jobs run slowly, consider adding more **core nodes** or increasing instance size.\n",
    "    - If jobs are short-lived, consider using **smaller instance types** like `r5.large` or `m5.large` to minimize costs.\n",
