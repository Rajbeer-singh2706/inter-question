    "### Recommended AWS Glue Configuration for 10 GB Data Processing\n",
    "'''\n",
    "1. Worker Type: AWS Glue offers three types of workers:\n",
    "   Standard: Suitable for simple, lightweight ETL jobs.\n",
    "   G.1X: A more powerful worker with 4 vCPUs, 16 GB memory.\n",
    "   G.2X: Twice as powerful as G.1X, offering 8 vCPUs and 32 GB memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For 10 GB of data with typical complexity, G.1X workers are usually sufficient, but for more complex transformations \n",
    "   (e.g., joining, aggregating, or processing semi-structured data), G.2X workers might be better.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Number of Workers: You can calculate the number of workers based on data size and complexity. \n",
    "A rule of thumb is that each G.1X worker can handle approximately 2-3 GB of data efficiently in parallel processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For 10 GB of data, start with 4-6 G.1X workers. This should ensure enough processing power to handle the workload efficiently \n",
    "without over-provisioning. If the job is complex or time-sensitive, you can increase the number of workers or use G.2X workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Memory: If you're dealing with large datasets or heavy computations (like joins, aggregations), you may want to allocate \n",
    "more memory per worker. G.1X has 16 GB memory, which is typically enough, but if you hit memory issues, \n",
    "consider scaling up to G.2X workers, which offer 32 GB memory per worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Execution Time: AWS Glue pricing is based on worker-hours. More workers or more powerful workers (G.2X) will finish the job faster, \n",
    "but also cost more per worker-hour. Find a balance between performance and cost.\n",
    "\n",

    "   increase the number of workers or switch to G.2X workers.\n",
