Here‚Äôs a list of questions asked in my interview at Amazon for the role of Data Engineer‚Üí
Hope it helps! üöÄ

The interview process had 4 rounds, each focused on different aspects of data engineering.

üìç ROUND 1: Data Modeling & SQL

The round started with a quick introduction and questions around my experience with data modeling and SQL. Here are some of the questions:

1.‚Å† ‚Å†Write a SQL query to fetch the top 3 highest-earning employees from each department. 
2.‚Å† ‚Å†How would you design a data model for an e-commerce application (customers, products, orders)? 
3.‚Å† ‚Å†Explain normalization and denormalization‚Äîwhen would you use each? 
4.‚Å† ‚Å†What is a composite primary key, and in which scenario would you use it? 
5.‚Å† ‚Å†How do you handle performance tuning in SQL queries? 
6.‚Å† ‚Å†How would you implement slowly changing dimensions (SCDs) in a data warehouse?

üìç ROUND 2: Big Data & Distributed Systems

This round dug deeper into my knowledge of big data technologies and scalable systems:

1.‚Å† ‚Å†How would you design a data pipeline to process 1 TB of data daily in real-time? 
2.‚Å† ‚Å†Explain the differences between Hadoop, Spark, and Flink. Which one would you choose for real-time data processing and why? 
3.‚Å† ‚Å†How do you optimize data storage for large-scale datasets on AWS S3?
4.‚Å† ‚Å†Explain partitioning in Hive and how it improves query performance. 
5.‚Å† ‚Å†How would you process a huge dataset using AWS Glue or EMR? 

üìç ROUND 3: AWS & Cloud Services

This round focused heavily on AWS services and how they can be used in data engineering:

1.‚Å† ‚Å†Describe your experience with AWS Redshift and how you optimized query performance. 
2.‚Å† ‚Å†How would you architect a scalable ETL pipeline using AWS Lambda and Step Functions? 
3.‚Å† ‚Å†Explain how you would handle security and data governance in an AWS data lake setup. 
4.‚Å† ‚Å†Discuss your experience with AWS Glue, Redshift, and S3. What are the best practices for optimizing storage and retrieval? 
5.‚Å† ‚Å†How would you implement real-time data ingestion and processing using Kinesis or Kafka?
Even though I didn‚Äôt make it through all the rounds, it was a valuable learning experience.
‚≠ê Personal Advice: Amazon‚Äôs interviews, especially for Data Engineers, are very scenario-based and focused on real-world applications. I realized that I could have done better if I practiced more on distributed systems and AWS architecture.
