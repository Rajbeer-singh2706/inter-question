    "'''\n",
    " AWS Glue is a fully managed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service that makes it easy to prepare and load data for analytics. \n",
    "     Its primary components are:\n",
    "   - **Data Catalog**: A central repository to store metadata about data sources, such as databases, tables, and columns.\n",
    "   - **Crawlers**: Used to discover data in sources and infer its schema.\n",
    "   - **ETL Jobs**: Python or Scala scripts that extract, transform, and load data between different data stores.\n",
    "   - **Triggers**: Used to orchestrate ETL workflows by triggering jobs based on schedules or events.\n",
    "   - **Workflows**: Enable the orchestration of complex ETL processes, connecting jobs and triggers.\n",

    "'''\n",
    " Crawlers in AWS Glue connect to data sources (like S3, JDBC, or DynamoDB), traverse them, and extract metadata to create or \n",

    "'''\n",
    " To optimize an AWS Glue ETL job for large datasets, follow these best practices:\n",
    "\n",
    " - 1. **Partitioning**: Ensure your data is properly partitioned in S3 or other sources to allow for parallel processing.\n",
    " - 2. **Memory Management**: Use the appropriate worker types and number of workers for your job (Standard vs. G.1X or G.2X workers).\n",
    " - 3. **Data Pruning**: Use Glue Pushdown predicates to filter data at the source level to reduce data size.\n",
    " - 4. **Job Bookmarking**: Enable job bookmarking to process only new or modified data in incremental jobs.\n",
    " - 5. **Parallel Processing**: Ensure that your Glue job leverages parallelism by tuning the Spark configurations for memory, \n",
    " shuffle partitions, and concurrency.\n",

    "   can be restored if needed.\n",
