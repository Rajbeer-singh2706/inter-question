    "\n",
    "### Basic Architecture and Concepts:\n",
    "'''\n",
    "1. **What is Amazon Redshift?**\n",
    "   - Expected Answer: Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud. It allows users to run complex queries \n",
    "and analytics across large datasets.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. **How does Redshift store data?**\n",
    "'''\n",
    " Redshift stores data in a columnar format, which means data is stored column by column rather than row by row. This allows for more efficient \n",
    " storage and faster query performance, especially for large analytical workloads.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. **What is the role of a Leader Node and Compute Node in Redshift?**\n",
    "'''\n",
    "   - Expected Answer: The Leader Node is responsible for query parsing, planning, and coordination of query execution. Compute Nodes perform the actual data processing and return the results to the Leader Node.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Data Loading:\n",
    "#4. **What command is commonly used to load data into Redshift?**\n",
    "'''\n",
    "  The `COPY` command is used to load data from Amazon S3, DynamoDB, or other data sources into Redshift tables. It is optimized for fast\n",
    "  parallel loading.\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "\n",
    "#5. **What file formats can be used when loading data into Redshift?**\n",
    "'''\n",
    " Redshift supports several formats such as CSV, JSON, Avro, Parquet, and ORC. Parquet and ORC are preferred for optimized query performance \n",
    " and storage.\n",

    "# 6. **What is a sort key in Redshift, and why is it important?**\n",
    "'''\n",
    " A sort key defines the order in which data is stored in a table. It helps optimize query performance by reducing the amount of data that \n",

    "'''\n",
    " A distribution key determines how data is distributed across compute nodes. Choosing the correct distribution key can improve query \n",
