When asked about **what happens internally when we do a `spark-submit`**, it's important to show a deep understanding of the Spark job submission process, including the architecture, resource management, and the flow of execution. Here's a detailed breakdown of the steps that occur:

### 1. **Client Submits the Application**:
   When you run `spark-submit`, it packages and submits your Spark application (a JAR, Python file, or script) to the cluster manager for execution. The `spark-submit` command includes several configurations like the main class (for Java/Scala), master URL (to specify the cluster), and other Spark-specific configurations (e.g., memory allocation, number of executors, etc.).

   ```bash
   spark-submit \
   --master yarn \
   --deploy-mode cluster \
   --class com.example.MyApp \
   myapp.jar
   ```

### 2. **Spark Driver Initialization**:
   After submitting the application, the **Driver Program** is launched. The **Driver** is the core component that coordinates the execution of tasks by creating and managing the **SparkContext**. Its responsibilities include:
   - Converting your **application code** into **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** of tasks.
   - Scheduling and distributing these tasks to the **executors** across the cluster.
   - Collecting and aggregating the results from the executors.

   The driver runs either on the **client node** (in client mode) or on one of the cluster nodes (in cluster mode), depending on the `--deploy-mode` specified.

### 3. **Cluster Manager Involvement**:
   The **Cluster Manager** (like **YARN**, **Kubernetes**, **Mesos**, or Spark’s standalone mode) is responsible for resource management in the Spark cluster. When the Driver requests resources, the Cluster Manager allocates them based on available nodes in the cluster.

   - **Client Mode**: The Driver runs on the machine where `spark-submit` was executed, and it communicates with the Cluster Manager to request resources (executors).
   - **Cluster Mode**: The Driver is launched on one of the cluster nodes, and resource requests and task scheduling happen directly from the cluster.

### 4. **Application Execution Flow**:
   Once the Driver is initialized, the following sequence happens:

   #### 4.1 **DAG Construction**:
   - The Driver analyzes the submitted Spark job and breaks it down into a **DAG** of stages, where each stage consists of tasks that can be executed in parallel. This DAG creation is done based on **transformations** like `map()`, `filter()`, and **actions** like `count()` or `collect()`.
   - The DAG is further broken down into **job stages**, based on shuffle boundaries (e.g., between wide transformations that require shuffling data across nodes).

   #### 4.2 **Job and Task Scheduling**:
   - The Driver then requests resources (executors) from the Cluster Manager.
   - The **executors** are responsible for executing tasks and storing the data for the job. Each stage in the DAG is divided into **tasks** based on the number of partitions of the input RDD (or DataFrame). The Driver schedules these tasks and sends them to the executors.
   - The **TaskScheduler** schedules tasks to run on different executors in parallel.

   #### 4.3 **Executor Launch**:
   - Once the Cluster Manager allocates resources, the Driver launches **executors** on the worker nodes.
   - **Executors** are JVM processes that run on each worker node. They are responsible for:
     - Executing individual **tasks** as directed by the Driver.
     - Performing the actual computations on the data partitions (e.g., map, reduce operations).
     - Storing the intermediate results either in-memory or on-disk based on the storage level (persistence/caching).
     - Communicating with the Driver to report task completion and results.

   #### 4.4 **Executor Registration**:
   - Executors register with the Driver, letting it know they are ready to receive tasks.
   - Executors are long-running processes. They exist for the duration of the Spark application and can execute multiple tasks across multiple stages of the application.

### 5. **Execution of Tasks by Executors**:
   - Executors start processing the **tasks** (parallel units of work). Each task typically corresponds to one partition of data.
   - The Driver keeps track of the task execution status, and when a task completes, the executor sends the result back to the Driver.

### 6. **Fault Tolerance and Task Retry**:
   - Spark provides **fault tolerance** through lineage information stored in the DAG. If any task fails, the Driver reassigns the task to another executor, leveraging the lineage to recompute the lost data.
   - If an executor fails, Spark will request more resources from the Cluster Manager to launch a replacement executor.

### 7. **Job Completion and Results Collection**:
   - After all the tasks for a job are completed, the results are sent back to the Driver, where final actions (like `collect()` or `save()` to an external system) are performed.
   - If the result is small enough (in memory), it is returned to the client. Otherwise, the data is written to a distributed storage system like HDFS, S3, or a database.

### 8. **Resource Cleanup**:
   - Once the application is complete, the Driver program shuts down and releases resources.
   - Executors are terminated, and the cluster resources are freed for other jobs.
   - Intermediate data (RDDs/DataFrames) in the executors is also released unless specified otherwise (e.g., if cached).

### Detailed Flow:
1. **Submit Application**: `spark-submit` sends the application to the cluster.
2. **Driver Initialization**: Driver starts and creates the SparkContext.
3. **Resource Request**: Driver requests resources from the Cluster Manager.
4. **Task Scheduling**: SparkContext creates a DAG, divides it into stages, and schedules tasks.
5. **Executor Launch**: Executors start on worker nodes and register with the Driver.
6. **Task Execution**: Executors execute tasks (e.g., transformations) on data partitions.
7. **Shuffle and Aggregation**: If shuffling is needed, data is shuffled across nodes.
8. **Task Completion**: Executors send results back to the Driver.
9. **Job Completion**: After all tasks complete, the job finishes, and results are returned or saved.
10. **Cleanup**: Executors are shut down, and resources are freed.

### Key Components:
- **Driver**: Coordinates the execution of tasks and handles the application lifecycle.
- **Cluster Manager**: Manages resources across the cluster.
- **Executors**: Perform the actual computations by running tasks and storing intermediate results.

### Optimizations to Mention:
- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Ensures that resources (executors) are dynamically allocated or deallocated based on job requirements.
- **Task Parallelism**: Spark’s ability to execute tasks in parallel across multiple executors.
- **Fault Tolerance**: In case of task or executor failure, Spark reassigns tasks to other available resources.

### Conclusion:
When you do a `spark-submit`, it triggers a complex but highly optimized workflow involving the **Driver**, **Cluster Manager**, and **Executors**. The Driver orchestrates everything from breaking down the code into a DAG, to resource management, task scheduling, and result collection. The Executors carry out the heavy lifting, performing tasks in parallel across the cluster, making Spark a powerful engine for distributed data processing.
