    "Here are some senior-level shell scripting interview questions and their solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **How do you schedule a job to run at 2 AM every day using `cron`?**\n",
    "   - **Question Intent**: Tests knowledge of cron jobs and scheduling.\n",
    "   - **Solution**: \n",
    "     To schedule a job at 2 AM every day, you add a cron job using the following syntax:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     0 2 * * * /path/to/your/script.sh\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     This cron job will trigger the `script.sh` script at 2 AM daily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Explain how to check if a file exists and is readable in a shell script.**\n",
    "   - **Question Intent**: Tests understanding of file handling in shell scripts.\n",
    "   - **Solution**:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     if [ -r /path/to/file ]; then\n",
    "       echo \"File exists and is readable\"\n",
    "     else\n",
    "       echo \"File does not exist or is not readable\"\n",
    "     fi\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Write a script to find and delete files older than 7 days in a directory.**\n",
    "   - **Question Intent**: Tests the ability to handle file cleanup tasks.\n",
    "   - **Solution**:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     find /path/to/directory -type f -mtime +7 -exec rm -f {} \\;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     This command will find all files in the directory that are older than 7 days and delete them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **How would you pass arguments to a shell script and access them inside the script?**\n",
    "   - **Question Intent**: Tests knowledge of argument handling.\n",
    "   - **Solution**:\n",
    "     A shell script can take arguments as follows:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     #!/bin/bash\n",
    "     echo \"First argument: $1\"\n",
    "     echo \"Second argument: $2\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     You can call this script as:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     ./script.sh arg1 arg2\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Write a script to monitor CPU usage and send an alert if it exceeds 90%.**\n",
    "   - **Question Intent**: Tests system monitoring and automation skills.\n",
    "   - **Solution**:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     #!/bin/bash\n",
    "     CPU_USAGE=$(top -bn1 | grep \"Cpu(s)\" | sed \"s/.*, *\\([0-9.]*\\)%* id.*/\\1/\" | awk '{print 100 - $1}')\n",
    "     \n",
    "     if (( $(echo \"$CPU_USAGE > 90\" | bc -l) )); then\n",
    "       echo \"CPU usage is above 90%: $CPU_USAGE%\" | mail -s \"High CPU Usage Alert\" user@example.com\n",
    "     fi\n",

    "   - **Question Intent**: Tests debugging and problem-solving skills.\n",
    "   - **Solution**:\n",
    "     To debug a shell script, you can use `set -x` to trace the execution and `set +x` to turn it off. Example:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     #!/bin/bash\n",
    "     set -x\n",
    "     # Your script logic\n",

    "   - **Question Intent**: Tests knowledge of file redirection.\n",
    "   - **Solution**:\n",
    "     - `>` is used to overwrite a file.\n",
    "     - `>>` is used to append to a file.\n",
    "     Example:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     echo \"New content\" > file.txt  # Overwrites the file\n",
