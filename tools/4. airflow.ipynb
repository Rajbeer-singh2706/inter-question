    "#For an intermediate-level Airflow interview, you might encounter questions that focus on practical experience with Airflow, \n",
    "#including how to manage and troubleshoot workflows, optimize performance, and use Airflowâ€™s features effectively. Here are some sample questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "1. **What are the key differences between Airflow 1.x and 2.x?**\n",
    "   - Answer should cover improvements such as the introduction of the new scheduler, improved UI, enhanced performance, and security features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How do you manage dependencies between tasks in an Airflow DAG?**\n",
    "   - Discuss the use of task dependencies using `set_upstream` and `set_downstream`, or more commonly `>>` and `<<` operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Explain how you would use XComs in Airflow.**\n",
    "   - Describe how XComs are used for sharing data between tasks and how to push and pull XComs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What strategies do you use to handle task retries and failure handling in Airflow?**\n",
    "   - Discuss setting `retries`, `retry_delay`, `retry_exponential_backoff`, and handling retries through `on_failure_callback`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **How would you optimize the performance of an Airflow DAG?**\n",
    "   - Talk about optimizing DAG design, using task parallelism, adjusting the concurrency settings, and possibly using the Kubernetes Executor or Celery Executor.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **How do you handle secrets and sensitive information in Airflow?**\n",
    "   - Mention using Airflowâ€™s connections and variables, integrating with secret management systems like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **What are the best practices for writing and organizing Airflow DAGs?**\n",
    "   - Cover topics such as modularizing DAGs, using reusable components, and maintaining clear and concise code.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Can you explain the purpose and usage of Airflowâ€™s `BranchPythonOperator`?**\n",
    "   - Discuss how `BranchPythonOperator` is used to conditionally choose which path a DAG should take based on some logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Describe a challenging problem you faced with Airflow and how you resolved it.**\n",
    "   - Provide a real-world example of a problem you encountered, such as a performance issue, and the steps you took to address it.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **How do you monitor and log Airflow tasks?**\n",
    "    - Explain the use of Airflowâ€™s built-in logging, monitoring tools, and how you can integrate with external monitoring systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions aim to assess your hands-on experience with Airflow and your ability to apply that knowledge to real-world scenarios.\n",
