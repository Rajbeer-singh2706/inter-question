       "\"\\nQ1) **How does Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) affect multithreading?**\\n   - Expected Answer: The GIL is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple native threads from executing \\n   Python bytecodes simultaneously. This can limit the effectiveness of multithreading for CPU-bound tasks but not for I/O-bound tasks.\\n\\nQ2) **How would you implement a custom iterator in Python?**\\n   - Expected Answer: A custom iterator can be implemented by defining a class with `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods. Example:\\n   ```python\\n   class MyIterator:\\n       def __init__(self, start, end):\\n           self.current = start\\n           self.end = end\\n\\n       def __iter__(self):\\n           return self\\n\\n       def __next__(self):\\n           if self.current >= self.end:\\n               raise StopIteration\\n           self.current += 1\\n           return self.current - 1\\n   ```\\n\\nQ3) Explain the concept of metaclasses in Python.**\\n   - Expected Answer: A metaclass is a class of a class that defines how a class behaves. A class is an instance of a metaclass. Metaclasses allow customization of class creation and can be used to enforce rules or modify classes.\\n\\nQ4) **How would you optimize a large dataset processing task in Python?**\\n   - Expected Answer: You can optimize by using generators for memory efficiency, leveraging multiprocessing or threading \\n   for parallel execution, using efficient libraries like NumPy or Pandas, and performing operations in chunks to handle large datasets.\\n\\nQ5) **What is the difference between `is` and `==` in Python?**\\n   - Expected Answer: `is` checks for object identity (whether two references point to the same object),\\n     while `==` checks for value equality (whether two objects have the same value).\\n\\n\""

    "### **Basic Python Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q1) What is the difference between `list`, `tuple`, and `set` in Python?**\n",
    "   - Expected Answer: A list is a mutable, ordered collection. \n",
    "   A tuple is an immutable, ordered collection. A set is an unordered collection of unique elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2) How does Python handle memory management?\n",
    "   - Expected Answer: Python uses an automatic memory management system that includes a private heap containing all \n",
    "   Python objects and data structures. The memory manager handles allocation and deallocation of memory, and the garbage collector \n",
    "   reclaims memory by deleting unused objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3) Explain the concept of list comprehensions with an example.\n",
    "   - Expected Answer: A list comprehension provides a concise way to create lists. Example:\n",
    "   squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4) How do you handle exceptions in Python?\n",
    "   - Expected Answer: Exceptions in Python are handled using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks. Example:\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       result = 10 / 0\n",
    "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "       print(\"You can't divide by zero!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "5) What is the difference between `deepcopy` and `shallow copy`?\n",
    "   - Expected Answer: A shallow copy creates a new object but inserts references into it to the objects found in the original. \n",
    "   A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all objects found in the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Intermediate Python Questions**\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q1) What are decorators in Python? How are they used?\n",
    "   - Expected Answer: Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of another function. They are used to add functionality to \n",
    "   existing code. Example:\n",
    "   def decorator_function(original_function):\n",
    "       def wrapper_function(*args, **kwargs):\n",
    "           print(f\"Wrapper executed before {original_function.__name__}\")\n",
    "           return original_function(*args, **kwargs)\n",
    "       return wrapper_function\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2) **Explain the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`.**\n",
    "   - Expected Answer: `@staticmethod` defines a method that doesn't operate on an instance of the class or the class itself. \n",
    "   `@classmethod` defines a method that operates on the class itself, passing the class as the first argument (usually `cls`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3) **What are `*args` and `**kwargs`, and how are they used?**\n",
    "   - Expected Answer: `*args` allows you to pass a variable number of positional arguments to a function. `**kwargs` \n",
    "   allows you to pass a variable number of keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4) **How would you implement a singleton design pattern in Python?**\n",
    "   - Expected Answer: A singleton design pattern can be implemented by controlling the instance creation so that only one instance exists. Example:\n",
    "   class Singleton:\n",
    "       _instance = None\n",
    "\n",
    "       def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):\n",
    "           if not cls._instance:\n",
    "               cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls, *args, **kwargs)\n",
    "           return cls._instance\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5) **What are Python generators, and how do they differ from regular functions?**\n",
    "   - Expected Answer: Generators are functions that return an iterable set of items one at a time, using \n",
    "   `yield` instead of `return`. They are more memory-efficient because they generate items on the fly.\n",
