Python threads run in the same memory space and are lightweight but limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time.\n",

    "1. **Profiling Your Code:**\n",
    "   - **cProfile**: A built-in Python module that provides a way to measure where time is being spent in your code.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `python -m cProfile your_script.py` to see detailed statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Optimizing Loops:**\n",
    "   - Avoid redundant calculations inside loops.\n",
    "   - Use list comprehensions where possible as they are generally faster than traditional for-loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using Built-in Functions and Libraries:**\n",
    "   - Pythons built-in functions and libraries are usually implemented in C and are faster than custom Python code.\n",
    "   - Example: Use `sum()` instead of manually summing elements in a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Avoiding Global Variables:**\n",
    "   - Global variables are slower than local variables. Keep variables inside functions where possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Using Efficient Data Structures:**\n",
    "   - Choose appropriate data structures, such as using sets for membership tests instead of lists.\n",
    "   - Use `deque` from `collections` for faster queue operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Memory Management:**\n",
    "   - Use generators instead of lists when handling large datasets to reduce memory usage.\n",
    "   - Example: Instead of `[x*x for x in range(1000000)]`, use `(x*x for x in range(1000000))`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Parallelism and Concurrency:**\n",
    "   - Use multiprocessing or threading to parallelize CPU-bound or I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "   - Example: Use `concurrent.futures` for easier management of parallel tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Using Numba for Just-In-Time Compilation:**\n",
    "   - Numba is a JIT compiler that translates Python functions into optimized machine code at runtime.\n",
    "   - Example: Annotate functions with `@jit` to speed up numerical computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Caching Results:**\n",
    "   - Use `functools.lru_cache` to cache the results of expensive function calls.\n",
    "   - Example: Annotate with `@lru_cache` to avoid redundant calculations for functions with the same inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Avoiding Excessive Object Creation:**\n",
    "    - Minimize the creation of unnecessary objects, which can slow down your program due to memory allocation overhead.\n",
