A **decorator** in Python is a special type of function that can modify or enhance the behavior of other functions or methods. 
Decorators allow for a clean and reusable way to extend the functionality of existing functions without altering their code directly.

### Basic Concept:
A decorator is simply a function that takes another function as an argument, adds some functionality to it, and then returns a new function (or the same function, but modified). It's often used to add "wrapping" logic around functions to avoid code repetition.

### Syntax:
In Python, decorators are applied to functions using the `@decorator_name` syntax, right before the function definition.
'
### Example of a Simple Decorator:

# Step 1: Define a decorator function
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something before the function.")
        func()
        print("Something after the function.")
    return wrapper

# Step 2: Use the decorator with a function
@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

# Step 3: Call the decorated function
say_hello()

### Output:
```
Something before the function.
Hello!
Something after the function.
```
''
#### Explanation:
1. The function `my_decorator` is a decorator that takes the function `say_hello` as an argument.
2. Inside the decorator, it defines a `wrapper` function that runs some additional code **before** and **after** the original 
function (`func`).
3. The `wrapper` function is returned and replaces the original `say_hello` function.
4. When `say_hello()` is called, the actual `wrapper()` function gets executed, which adds the extra functionality 
around `say_hello`.

### Another Example: Timing a Function

You can use a decorator to measure the execution time of a function:


import time

def timer_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()  # Start the timer
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()    # End the timer
        print(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer_decorator
def slow_function():
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulates a slow task
    print("Function completed.")

# Call the decorated function
slow_function()
```

### Output:
```
Function completed.
Execution time: 2.002 seconds
```
'
### Explanation:
- `timer_decorator` adds timing functionality around `slow_function`.
- When `slow_function` is called, it measures the time taken to execute it and prints the execution time.

### Key Points:
1. **Decorator Syntax (`@decorator_name`)**: A clean and concise way to apply decorators.
2. **Functionality Enhancement**: Decorators add functionality (logging, timing, authentication, etc.) without modifying the original function.
3. **Wrapper Function**: Inside the decorator, a `wrapper` function is commonly used to wrap additional logic around the original function call.
4. **Arguments (`*args` and `**kwargs`)**: Decorators can handle functions with any number of positional or keyword arguments using `*args` and `**kwargs`.

This allows decorators to be highly flexible and reusable in Python programs.
